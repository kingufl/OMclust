This module takes Rmap file and a range of num_clusters as input and produces trained cluster centers for each along with key statistics and runtimes 
This pipeline is suitable when the number of clusters is unknown and needs to be assessed. 
This module does not produce Rmap relations. The output of this module can be fed into module 3 to produce relations.

The steps of this module are as follows.

step 1: extract kmers. Run extractkmers.sh (edit the location of Rmap file)
step 2: train and classify kmers to clusters. Run runclustering.sh (edit num_clusters and location of kmerfile)
step 3: run silhouette analysis script. Run runsilhouette.sh
step 4: prepare statistics and runtimes. Run makestats.sh
