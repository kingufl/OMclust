This module takes Rmap file, number of clusters and m-value as input and produces trained cluster centers and Rmap relations as output. 
This pipeline is suitable when the number of clusters are known.

The steps of this module are as follows.

step 1: extract kmers. Run extractkmers.sh (edit the location of Rmap file)
step 2: train and classify kmers to clusters. Run runclustering.sh (edit num_clusters and location of kmerfile)
step 3: extract cluster centers and cluster assignments from training output. Run extractclusters.sh (edit location of training_output_file)
step 4: findrelations. Run findrelations.sh (edit locations of rmapfile, infofile, cluster_assignments and m-value)
